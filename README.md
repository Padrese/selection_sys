# Selective System project C++
Simple model giving academical training positions to students based on standard criterions, using Gale-Shapley's algorithm. Inspired by the French selection system Parcoursup for higher academical training.

This project is an implementation of a selection algorithm for students and trainings post-high school. This project is inspired by French selection system Parcoursup (successor of "Admission Post-Bac") who uses Gale-Shapley's algorithm to aim the same goals as this project. 

Parcoursup's database and criterions are more elaborated than this project, but social criterions and the opacity of the implementation of the selection algorithm have been under heavy criticizing from the government's political opposition and from the students themselves since its creation in 2018. However, contrary to the global belief, the code and documentation linked to Parcoursup's algorithms are open-source, available in this GitHub project: https://gitlab.mim-libre.fr/parcoursup/algorithmes-de-parcoursup

Thus, this project aims to build a simple model based on more social criterions (selection system based only on the grades of the student, behavior penalties, knowledge of personal issues unrelated to school,...) that neglect the actual (as of 2024) context in universities (limited availability in training due to the high number of candidates, lack of financial investment in research and university training, etc). This is the second C++ project of its creator (Alan Lebreux, 2024 all rights reserved).
